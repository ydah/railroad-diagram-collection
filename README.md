# Programming Language Railroad Diagrams

A collection of railroad diagrams (syntax diagrams) for various programming languages to serve as a visual reference for developers.

## Overview

This repository contains a website that compiles railroad diagrams for different programming languages. Railroad diagrams provide a visual representation of language syntax, making it easier to understand grammar rules compared to traditional BNF notation.

## Current Languages

The collection currently includes railroad diagrams for:

- **Ruby** - A dynamic, object-oriented language known for its elegant syntax
- **PHP** - A widely-used scripting language especially suited for web development
- **Perl** - A family of programming languages known for text processing capabilities

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── index.html         # Main landing page
├── ruby.html          # Ruby railroad diagrams
├── php.html           # PHP railroad diagrams
├── perl.html          # Perl railroad diagrams
└── README.md          # This file
```

## Purpose

Railroad diagrams help developers:
- Quickly understand language syntax
- Visualize complex grammar rules
- See valid code structures at a glance
- Learn new languages more intuitively

## Contributing

Want to contribute railroad diagrams for other programming languages? Follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new HTML file for your language used by [Lrama](https://github.com/ruby/lrama) (e.g., `python.html`)
3. Follow the existing format used in other language files
4. Add your language to the main page (`index.html`)
5. Submit a pull request

## Requirements for Contributions

When creating railroad diagrams for new languages:

- Ensure diagrams are accurate and reflect the current language specification
- Include references to official language documentation
- Follow the established style guidelines
- Ensure the page is accessible and works across different browsers

## Future Plans

- Add more programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.)
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add search functionality
- Create a consistent style guide for all diagrams
